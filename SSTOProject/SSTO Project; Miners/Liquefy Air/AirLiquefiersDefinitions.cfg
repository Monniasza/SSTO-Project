When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  While this smaller model is lighter than it's bigger cousin, it is less efficient, and not designed for long-term operations.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.
